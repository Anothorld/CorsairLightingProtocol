# DISCLAIMERS
This is a DO IT YOURSELF project, use at your own risk.

THIS IS NOT PLUG AND PLAY.
You MAY need to use a custom Bootloader for the Arduino and/or custom Arduino core.

Changing the VID and PID of your Arduino forces you to use a custom boards configuration, otherwise the Arduino is lost(can not be detected by the IDE).
